# SSCMaster

__SSC Master__ aims to become a better __UBC Student Service Centre (SSC)__ for students. 

It parses SSC websites data for all ubc courses and renders them on Android phones. 
* You can check out a course description on this app
* You can search for a course on this app
* You can also be notified when a new seat becomes available on this app!

This version is still under development, but the two previous versions of this app has achieved the same goal using different appoarches.
The development of this app basically reflected my software design learning process. This time I started with UI design and backend abstraction.
So this version brings a much better UI (although is still not that impress T.T) and a way cleaner backend management system.

Currently, the app has been able to render faculty, department, and course list views. Detailed course view and section view will be 
supported soon.
